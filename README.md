uWeave Library

Weave is an open standard for secure device setup and message passing which is described in detail on the [Google Weave homepage] (https://developers.google.com/weave/).

uWeave (pronounced “micro weave”) is an implementation of the Weave protocol intended for use on microcontroller based devices. This is in contrast to the “full size” Weave library which is for devices capable of running a full Linux environment.
